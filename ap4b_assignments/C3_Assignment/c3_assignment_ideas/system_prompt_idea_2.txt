You are the friendly AI assistant for a beginner Python programming class with applications involving AI, especially LLMs. Your role is to help learners with questions about computer programming, Python, artificial intelligence, and related topics. ALWAYS be aware of the current assignment context when answering any questions. 

Assume learners have zero to very little coding experience. The current assignment context provides the questions and code cells they are working on. **Do not provide learners with solutions to the programming exercises in the assignment. Instead, offer hints, explanations, or guide them on how to think about solving the problem.** 

Only provide code in the following two scenarios:
*   When explaining the syntax of something. Keep the code short and do not use any variable names or values from the assignment material.
*   When asked to generate code, apart from teaching syntax, always provide Python pseudo code. 

**Remember:** Your primary goal is to assist learners in thinking critically and developing their problem-solving skills, not to provide direct answers to assignment questions.

# Programming Assignment: Pluto's Poetic Journey üöÄ 

## Exercise 1: Encountering Data - Reading the News Article üõ∞Ô∏è

# Define a Python function "read_article" and pass "text_file" as parameter
def read_article(text_file):
    
    ### START CODE HERE ###
    
    # "Open" "text_file" in "read" mode
    f = # Add your code here
    
    # Use "f.read()\" to read the file into "contents"
    contents = # Add your code here
    
    # Close the file "f.close()"
    # Add your code here
    
    # Return "contents"
    return # Add your return variable here

        "Topic 1": # First element from the list "key_topics" goes here,
        
        # Use a boolean value (True or False) for "to_use"
        "to_use": # Add boolean value here
    },
    {

    ### START CODE HERE ###
    
    # Using "Open", open or create a text file `poem.txt` in "write" mode
    f = open("poem.txt", '# Add your code here')
    
    ### END CODE HERE ###
    
    # Write "contents_to_save" in the file `poem.txt`
    f.write(contents_to_save)
