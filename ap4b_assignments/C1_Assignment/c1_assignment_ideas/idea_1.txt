# Exercise 1: Otto's Dog Walking Business

# Otto, the dog whisperer, has started a dog walking business. 
# He wants to keep track of his earnings and needs your help!

# Write a program to help Otto:

# 1. Create a variable `dogs_walked` and set it to the number of dogs 
#    Otto walked today. Let's say he walked 3 dogs.
# 2. Create a variable `price_per_walk` and set it to the price Otto 
#    charges per walk. Let's say he charges $10 per walk.
# 3. Calculate Otto's total earnings for the day and store it in a variable 
#    called `total_earnings`.
# 4. Print a message that displays Otto's earnings, like this:
#    "Otto earned $___ today!"

# Remember to test your code!


### THIS IS SOLUTION CODE
dogs_walked = 3
price_per_walk = 10
total_earnings = dogs_walked * price_per_walk
print(f"Otto earned ${total_earnings} today!")
```

```python
# Exercise 2: Calculating the Average

# Otto wants to know the average number of dogs he walks each day.

# He kept track of his walks for the past week:
# * Monday: 2 dogs
# * Tuesday: 5 dogs
# * Wednesday: 3 dogs
# * Thursday: 4 dogs
# * Friday: 2 dogs
# * Saturday: 6 dogs
# * Sunday: 1 dog

# 1. Create a variable for each day of the week and set it to the 
#    number of dogs walked that day.
# 2. Calculate the total number of dogs walked during the week.
# 3. Calculate the average number of dogs walked per day and store 
#    it in a variable called `average_dogs`.
# 4. Print a message that displays the average, like this:
#    "Otto walked an average of ___ dogs per day this week."

# Remember to test your code!

### THIS IS SOLUTION CODE
monday = 2
tuesday = 5
wednesday = 3
thursday = 4
friday = 2
saturday = 6
sunday = 1

total_dogs = monday + tuesday + wednesday + thursday + friday + saturday + sunday
average_dogs = total_dogs / 7

print(f"Otto walked an average of {average_dogs:.1f} dogs per day this week.")

```python
# Exercise 3:  Otto's Business Report

# Otto wants to create a weekly report using an LLM to make it look professional.
# Let's help him generate a report using the information from previous exercises.

from helper_functions import print_llm_response

# Use the following variables in your prompt:
# * `dogs_walked` (from Exercise 1) 
# * `total_earnings` (from Exercise 1)
# * `average_dogs` (from Exercise 2)

# Create a prompt for the LLM that includes the variables above and asks for:
# 1. A catchy title for the report.
# 2. A summary of the week's work, including the total dogs walked and earnings.
# 3. A note about the average number of dogs walked per day.

# Remember to test your code!

### THIS IS SOLUTION CODE
prompt = f"""Write a short business report for a dog walking business with a catchy title, 
a summary of the week's work (mentioning a total of {dogs_walked} dogs walked and total earnings of ${total_earnings}), 
and a note about how many dogs were walked on average each day (the average was {average_dogs:.1f})."""
